POPS : procedure oriented programming language
what is  the difference between POPS, OOPSl,
1) pops follows top down approach
2) pops is a function driven language
3) pops is a data driven language: data is more important than the program
4) pops is a sequential language : instructions are executed one after the other
5) pops is a structured language : it follows structured programming

eg:c, perl, fortran, cobol, pascal, basic, fortran, algol, lisp, prolog, ada, etc
-------------------------
oops:
1) oops follows bottom up approach
2) oops is an object driven language
3) oops is an object oriented language : object is more important than the data
4) oops is a non sequential language : instructions are not executed one after the other
5) oops is a non structured language : it does not follow structured programming
eg: c++, java, c#, vb.net, python, ruby, php, etc
-------------------------------------------------
OOPS : object oriented programming language

class based approach

iostream : input output stream




                                        IOS  --> PARENT CLASS

                           input                      output

                                       iostream                                         




//variable name declaration

1)variable name must not contans space....
2)




operaotrs:

1)arithmetic operators
2)logical operators
3)asinment operators
4)relational operators / comparison operators 
5)bitwise operators
6)conditional operators
7)increment and decrement operators
8)sizeof operator



oops concepts:
1)encapsulation : binding data and functions together in form of class object is called encapsulation
    class,object,constructor,destructor,access specifiers,member functions,member variables,static members,friend functions,friend classes,inline functions, this pointer, const keyword, mutable keyword, volatile keyword, virtual functions, pure virtual functions, abstract classes, etc
2)abstraction
3)inheritance
4)polymorphism



class and object:

class : class is a user defined data type which contains data members and member functions
       : class is group of data members and member functions
       : class is a blue print of an object

objecct : objecct is entity / identity of class        


class       OBJECTS
Vehicle     car, bike, bus, truck, etc
School      student, teacher, principal, etc
Fruit       Apple , mango, banana, etc


vehile has car
car is a vehicle
School has student, 

fruit has apple
apple is a fruit


struct
keyword class...


///practise  --->  
4 function calculator with return type and arguments add, sub, mul, div



constructor: 
constructor is a special function which has same name as class name
constructor can not have return type
const can have arguments
const is called automatically when object is created

use:
used to initialize the data members of class [instance variables]
used to allocate memory to the data members of class [instance variables]


in cpp one class must have one constructor
if developer will not write constructor then compiler will write default constructor

types of constructor:
1)default constructor
2)parameterized constructor
3)copy constructor
