1)encapsulation : binding code and data into a single unit
2)abstraction : hiding the implementation details
3)inheritance : acquiring the properties from parent class to child class
4)polymorphism : many forms
    method overloading
    method overriding



inheritance:
child class can use the properties of parent class this process is called inheritance, but parent class 
can't use the properties of child class
base class --> parent class
derived class --> child class

types of inheritance:
1)single inheritance    a -> b
2)multiple inheritance  a -> b,c | a,b -> c
3)multilevel inheritance a -> b -> c
4)hierarchical inheritance a -> b,c
                            a
                   b                c           
             x          y    p           q

5)hybrid inheritance a -> b,c -> d | a -> b -> c,d
                    a
            b               c
                d


use:
1)code reusability
